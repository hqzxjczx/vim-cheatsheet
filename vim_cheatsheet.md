:{range}sort u
Yes, it's that simple.

You could create a range in advance, such as 'a,. (from mark 'a' to the current line) or you could create one on-the-fly using visual selection by pressing ':' in visual mode, after selecting the text you wish to sort, to get a range of '<,'> on the command line.
:%s/foo/bar/g Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'.
:s/foo/bar/g Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and replace it with 'bar'.
:%s/foo/bar/gc Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first.
:%s/foo/bar/gci Change each 'foo' (case insensitive due to the i flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation
:%s/old/new/g - replace all old with new throughout file
:%s/old/new/gc - replace all old with new throughout file with confirmations
:5,12s/foo/bar/g Change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines from line 5 to line 12 (inclusive).
:'a,'bs/foo/bar/g Change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines from mark a to mark b inclusive
:'<,'>s/foo/bar/g  change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines within a visual selection
:.,$s/foo/bar/g Change each 'foo' to 'bar' for all lines from the current line (.) to the last line ($) inclusive.
:.,+2s/foo/bar/g	Change each 'foo' to 'bar' for the current line (.) and the two next lines (+2).
:g/^baz/s/foo/bar/g	Change each 'foo' to 'bar' in each line starting with 'baz'.

The g flag means global â€“ each occurrence in the line is changed, rather than just the first.

:noh - remove highlighting of search matches
<< shift left
>> shift right
